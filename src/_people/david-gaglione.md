David’s career in brand started with a singular focus on naming where he led new product naming initiatives for Coke, UPS, Subaru and other globally recognized brands. He leveraged his experience in naming to better understand the building blocks of a brand’s expression—strategy. His interest and intuition put him in the position to research then redefine the brand essence for NFL and Citi. Having defined brand and expressed that strategy in the simplest form—a name—he turned his focus to directing the visual expression of corporate and consumer brands. His experience in strategy then the visual and verbal expression of that strategy was the inspiration to a less traditional but holistic approach to brand consulting. The success of that unique approach was the catalyst to PS212’s launch.
