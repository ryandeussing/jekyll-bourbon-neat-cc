      Windows 10 represents a significant departure from the look, feel, and functionality of recent versions of Windows. Microsoft asked PS212 to consider the role of naming in support of those changes and the launch of Windows 10.

      PS212 explored a range of alternative naming approaches but, in keeping with the promise of Windows 10, recommended a descriptive system. The result—all edition names are real words, tell a story about the user or use environment.​
