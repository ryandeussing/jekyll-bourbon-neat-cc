      GE, a Worldwide Partner of the Olympic Games, was looking to stand out from the crowd of competing worldwide and national team partners.

      PS212 created a unique visual system for GE’s presence at the Vancouver, London, and Sochi Games—one that leverages GE’s corporate brand system to tell a relevant story of the Games.
